# My DevOps Portfolio

Hi — welcome to my DevOps portfolio! 

My name is David. I’m building my skills in DevOps practices and tools, focusing on automation, infrastructure, and continuous delivery.
This repository documens my learning journey, hands-on projects, and experiments as I grow in this field.
